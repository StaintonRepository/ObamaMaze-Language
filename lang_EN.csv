MISC_AUTHOR,Author: 
DESC_NORMAL,You find yourself trapped in a brick maze with 7 Obamiums to collect. You've got a flashlight, a tablet, and a radio to use while also finding beartraps on the floor to slow down Obama. Once you collect all 7 Obamiums find a bright exit.
DESC_TUTORIAL,Welcome to Obama Maze! Here is the place to go if you are confused about anything or to learn.
DESC_FOREST,You are trapped in a forest where you need to collect 7 Obamiums before you can leave. You spawn with your usual 3 starting items and be careful of the water that will slow you down.
DESC_ENDLESS,You are forever trapped in Obama's Maze collecting the highest of high score you can. This maze has infinite Obamiums and its still size limited.
DESC_NIGHTMARE,Welcome to an absolute Nightmare. Obama will outrun you even if you sprint, the tablet is more limited, the radio has a shorter range, all power drains faster and careful of corruption...\n\n<color=red>This Maze is currently unplayable.</color>
DESC_CORN,Welcome to the ranch! You will need to proceed inside and begin the maze on the computer. Only 1 Obamium can exist in the maze at a time so after you collect one you must find the exit again and submit it into the computer. Corn is breakable but will alert Obama to your location.\n\n<color=red>This Maze is currently unplayable.</color>
